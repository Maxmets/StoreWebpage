A fake clothing shop store, I created to recap and test out the skills I learned during this years first semester. 

The website has the whole male section currently done,  the landing page, and the contact page. 

In the future there are still multiple things that I want to imporve in this project such as: 

1) Finishing other sections of the store (mostly visuals there). 
2) Adding a true shopping cart system that recognizes the item that was added. (Further research is required)
3) Add a "Thank you, for contacting us" page. (possible could be done with PHP, as a HTML form submittion)
4)Fix all the small bugs including, proper sizing of the carousel images, so that the carousel does not change its size every time
  a picture swaps. 
  
Web development has been a very fun and unique learning experience. I will for sure continue exploring it in the future with more unique
ideas and projects. To strengthen my understanding and skills in creating web pages/applications.
